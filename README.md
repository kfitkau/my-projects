### [Project 1: Car Prediction]

- **Description:** The used car analysis used different regression models to evaluate the predictive performance for used car prices. The models were evaluated using two key metrics, the coefficient of determination (r2_score) and the mean squared error (MSE). Among the models tested, random forest models generally showed the best results with high r2_scores and low MSE values for different car brands. Decision tree models were acceptable, while linear regression, support vector regression and KNN models showed lower performances. It is noted that further optimization of the models and careful data cleaning could lead to possible improvements.
