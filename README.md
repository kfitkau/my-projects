## AI Projects

### [Project 1: Car Prediction]
- **Description:** The used car analysis used different regression models to evaluate the predictive performance for used car prices. The models were evaluated using two key metrics, the coefficient of determination (r2_score) and the mean squared error (MSE). Among the models tested, random forest models generally showed the best results with high r2_scores and low MSE values for different car brands. Decision tree models were acceptable, while linear regression, support vector regression and KNN models showed lower performances. It is noted that further optimization of the models and careful data cleaning could lead to possible improvements.
- **Technologies:** Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, scikit-learn

### [Project 2: GermEval21]
- **Description:** Germeval21, short for 'German Evaluation Campaign of Natural Language Processing and Computational Linguistics Systems,' is a pivotal event in the world of natural language processing and computational linguistics. Germeval 2021 Shared Task on the Identification of Toxic, Engaging, and Fact-Claiming Comments
- **Technologies:** Python, Wandb, Numpy, transformers, pytorch

### [Project 3: StableDiffusion UI]
- **Description:** The simple Stable Diffusion UI offers a user-friendly platform for exploring diffusion processes with StabilityAI's StableDiffusion
- **Technologies:** Python, Numpy, transformers, pytorch, Pillow (PIL Fork)

## Game/Simulation Projects

### [Project 4: GameOfLife]
- **Description:** This project visually simulates the cellular automaton devised by mathematician John Conway. I'm using SceneBuilder for the interface design. The application features play, pause, and reset buttons, allowing users to control the simulation's progress easily. Users can observe the evolution of the cell grid over time according to Conway's rules of birth, death, and survival.
- **Technologies:** Java Openjdk-22.0.1, JavaFX 17.0.11 SDK, SceneBuilder
